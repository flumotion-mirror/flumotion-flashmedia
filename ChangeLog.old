	* flumotion/component/producers/fms/fms.py:
	Fix re-timestamping and synchronisation.

	A trailing video buffer is sent after the reconnection with a weird
	timestamp (non-contiguous).It was causing gaps in the re-timestamping
	and introducing desyncs. This was fixed dropping buffers until we get
	a continous keyframe.

	Now that we know that this buffer is an H264 END_OF_SEQUENCE packet,
	we can set its timeamp to the last one received and start
	re-timestamping the next buffers from this resync point.
	The re-timestamping logic is more simple and robust:
	fixedTS = syncTS - syncOffset + timestamp

	Example:
	We received the last buffer with ts=10000. After the reconnection
	buffer1 has ts=100 and buffer2 has ts=140. We set syncTS=10000+x (where x
	is set to 40ms because a gap is needed from the last timestamp) and
	syncOffset=100
	We get after fixing the timestamps:
	buffer1 -> ts=10040
	buffer2 -> ts=10080
