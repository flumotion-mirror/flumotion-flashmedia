Release notes for Flumotion Flashmedia 0.10.0 "Gyoza"

The Flumotion team announces
the first release of the stable 0.10 branch
of the Flumotion Components for RTMP input.

Flumotion is a streaming media server created with the backing of
Fluendo. It features intuitive graphical administration tools, making
the task of setting up and manipulating audio and video streams easy for
even novice system administrators. Flumotion is released under the LGPL.

This project contains the components needed to receive video in RTMP
