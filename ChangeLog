	* flumotion/component/producers/fms/fms.py:
	Set the caps to the output pad just when we have the real caps (with
	the streamheader). Otherwise the negotiation is done without the
	streamheader and the stream cannot be parsed properly on the other
	side.

	* configure.ac:
	Require a lower gettext version

	* flumotion/component/producers/fms/fms.py:
	When setting the new stream header from the backup we shouldn't try to
	start streaming before sending the present buffer normaly.
	Add comments about the new behaviour.

2010-03-25  Jan Urbanski  <jurbanski@flumotion.com>

	* flumotion/component/producers/fms/fms.py:
	Log the exception message, not just the fact that an exception
	occurred.

	* flumotion/component/producers/fms/fms.py:
	Fix a bug when the video tag containing the sequence header comes before
	the new metadata and the codec didn't change. The change was not
	detected till the metadata came and the sequece header was dropped.
	Consequently, all the following tags were dropped because there were no
	sequence header.
	Fixes #8604

	Enable the component to accept reconnections from the encoder:
	  - When there are network problems
	  - When the encoder is stopped/restarted
	  - When the user changes the configuration of the encoded stream

	The bug the last commit worked around is now fixed.

2009-06-04  Sebastien Merle  <sebastien@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/producers/fms/fms.py:
	RTMPy seems to not report refused publish error to FME,
	so the encoder don't gives feedback and seems to stream
	normally even if the data is discarded by RTMPy.
	Force disconnection when refusing to publish a stream.

2009-06-04  Sebastien Merle  <sebastien@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/producers/fms/fms.py:
	Now properly set gstreamer DELTA_UNIT flag for audio buffer.
	This was preventing burst-to-keyframe to work properly.

2009-06-04  Sebastien Merle  <sebastien@fluendo.com>

	* flumotion/component/producers/fms/fms.py:
	Fixed to match the API modifications after commiting changes to flvlib.
	Need flvlib 0.1.5.
