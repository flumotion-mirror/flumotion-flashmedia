	* flumotion/component/producers/fms/fms.py:
	Fix re-timestamping and synchronisation.

	A trailing video buffer is sent after the reconnection with a weird
	timestamp (non-contiguous).It was causing gaps in the re-timestamping
	and introducing desyncs. This was fixed dropping buffers until we get
	a continous keyframe.

	Now that we know that this buffer is an H264 END_OF_SEQUENCE packet,
	we can set its timeamp to the last one received and start
	re-timestamping the next buffers from this resync point.
	The re-timestamping logic is more simple and robust:
	fixedTS = syncTS - syncOffset + timestamp

	Example:
	We received the last buffer with ts=10000. After the reconnection
	buffer1 has ts=100 and buffer2 has ts=140. We set syncTS=10000+x (where x
	is set to 40ms because a gap is needed from the last timestamp) and 
	syncOffset=100
	We get after fixing the timestamps:
	buffer1 -> ts=10040
	buffer2 -> ts=10080

	* flumotion/component/producers/fms/fms.py:
	  Add more debugging, so we clearly see when we receive the first
	  buffer for audio and video, and when we send them.
	  Don't trust bogus announcements of 1000 fps as framerate;
	  put in a hack to force it to 25 fps in that case.

	Set the caps to the output pad just when we have the real caps (with
	the streamheader). Otherwise the negotiation is done without the
	streamheader and the stream cannot be parsed properly on the other
	side.

	Fix a bug when the video tag containing the sequence header comes before
	the new metadata and the codec didn't change. The change was not

	sequence header.
	Fixes #8604
