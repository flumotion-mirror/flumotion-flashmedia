Testing
-------

Streaming from a file and save it to disk:
 - start server:
FLU_DEBUG=4 flumotion-launch flash-media-server-producer ! disk-consumer directory=/tmp filename=test

 - start client:
  bin/ffmpeg -i phoenix.mp4 -re -acodec copy -vcodec copy -f flv rtmp://localhost/live/stream.flv

Verify whether the server correctly parses the framerate of the video file.

Server should go from hungry to happy, and report first received buffers
and timestamps for audio and video.
